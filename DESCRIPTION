Title: Poisson Models for Quantifying DNA Copy-number from FISH Images of Tissue Sections

Description: FrenchFISH comprises a nuclear volume correction 
    method coupled with two types of Poisson models: either a 
    Poisson model for improved manual spot counting without the 
    need for control probes; or a homogenous Poisson Point 
    Process model for automated spot counting.
